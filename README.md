# [Project] Inheritance, Classes & Objects and Method Overloading in C#

## Description

This project is written in `C#` as part of my journey to becoming a backend developer. It serves as a practical exercise to test and enhance my skills in `inheritance`, `classes & objects`, and `method overloading`. Through this project, I aim to deepen my understanding of object-oriented programming concepts and how they can be applied to create flexible and maintainable code. 

## Features

- **Animal Base Class**: Contains common properties such as `Name`, `Age`, and `Color`, and a virtual method `AnimalSound`.
- **Dog Class**: Inherits from `Animal` and adds a `Breed` property. Overrides the `AnimalSound` method to provide a dog-specific sound.
- **Cat Class**: Inherits from `Animal` and adds an `IsIndoor` property. Overrides the `AnimalSound` method to provide a cat-specific sound.

## Output

When you run the project, you will see the following output:

- **This is my dog Fido! He is a 12 years old Black Siberian Husky.**<br>**Voff, Voff, Voff!**
- **This is my cat Missan! He is a 8 years old White indoor cat.**<br>**Meow, Meow, Meow!**
